# MinecraftServerManager

Hello! I'm Mr_maeazadi and I'm a C# Pre-Pre-Pre-Junior Developer. I tried to make an Application something like MCSS, for managing Minecraft Servers in a better and easier way!
I've written ALL OF THESE CODES BY MYSELF! I don't know if something is correct or not. Please tell me to make this app better. (you can DM me on Discord. mr_maeazadi)
So, let me tell you how to use this app.

Follow These Steps:
1- Download the app
2- Have a Minecraft Server prepared in a folder
3- Extract Application files into the Minecraft Server folder
4- Run the Application (Maybe Windows Defender gives you alerts and maybe it deletes the files.)
5- Head to the "Console" Tab and enter the required stuff (.jar file name: e.g. purpur-1.20.4 | Minimum Usage Of RAM in MB: e.g. 1024 | Maximum Usage of RAM in MB: e.g. 1024)
6- Click on start
7- Enjoy! :)

Cool Stuff:
Okay my app is a bit... lame? bad? or what ever, But it has some unique features that MCSS doesn't have!
Here are some of them (I guess):
1- In "Dashboard" Tab, You can Right-Click on players that are in the server and "Manage" them (for now we have: Kick, Ban, Fill Saturation, Heal, Hunger, OP, Deop, Say Hello, Give Them Golden Apple)
I'm planning to add more and even make it that you can customize it yourself!
2- In "Customize" Tab, You can Change your Application's Color and Font! then if you want, you can save that theme! (My Favorite ones are: Color: Orange, Font: Consolas)
3- If you have the App Discord, My app will sync to it (if you can say "sync") and changes your Discord Rich Presence and boy I love it!
4- I made this app in just pure C# and NO JAVA included (maybe for running the app)!
5- It has a built-in File Manager and File Editor!

Alright. That's all folks. Hope you enjoy! :)

Oh! there is one more thing. This app, has some easter eggs! Goodluck finding them!

See YA!
